**ChatGPT:**

The PDF contains two main problems related to Portfolio Theory and Practice.

**Problem 1: Expected Returns and Risks (5 points)**


- Questions about the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI, investing in an index, hedge funds, and their investments.
- Calculating expected return and standard deviation for the MSCI ACWI using Table 1 data.
- Computing the expected return of the hedge fund “Pandorra”.
- Discussing the reliability of historical data in predicting future returns and risks.
- Calculating the expected value of 100 CHF invested for 2 and 20 years.

**Problem 2: Asset Allocation (5 points)**


- Determining the mean-standard deviation frontier for stocks and bonds allocations.
- Identifying the global minimum-variance portfolio and the tangency portfolio, including their expected returns and risks.
- Finding an analytical expression for the capital allocation line (CAL).
- Calculating the optimal asset allocation for a given utility function.
- Creating a diagram visualizing the solutions from 2.1 to 2.4.

Let's start solving these problems. I'll begin with Problem 1.2: Calculating the expected return and standard deviation for the MSCI ACWI.

**You:**

Yes, proceed with Problem 2.

**ChatGPT:**

Problem 2 involves creating a mean-standard deviation frontier for different combinations of stocks and bonds. This frontier illustrates the best possible return for a given level of risk, based on the mix of these two asset classes. To calculate this, we need the expected returns, standard deviations, and the correlation coefficient between stocks and bonds, as provided in your document.

The expected return of a portfolio (E[R]) is given by:

The standard deviation of the portfolio (σ) is calculated using:

We will create a range of portfolio combinations by varying w from 0 to 1 in increments (e.g., 0.1) and calculate the expected return and standard deviation for each combination. Let's begin these calculations using the data provided in your document.

The next step is to identify the global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP) and the tangency portfolio from the calculated combinations. The GMVP is the portfolio with the lowest possible risk (standard deviation), and the tangency portfolio is the one that touches the capital market line, offering the highest Sharpe ratio.

**Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio (GMVP)**
To find the GMVP, we look for the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation from the previously calculated values.

**Tangency Portfolio**
The tangency portfolio can be found by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, which is the ratio of excess return (portfolio return minus the risk-free rate) to the standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio is given by:

![equation](https://github.com/4rbeez/random/assets/41131044/1f5ef713-4d72-4320-9d75-37a1eeb92860)

**Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**
The Capital Allocation Line (CAL) is the line that connects the risk-free asset to the tangency portfolio in the risk-return space. The analytical expression for CAL is:

![equation-1](https://github.com/4rbeez/random/assets/41131044/00192149-dd38-4c1b-9633-22ecf87b2eca)

First, let's identify the GMVP and the tangency portfolio. For the sake of this calculation, we'll assume a risk-free rate (which you need to provide if it differs). I'll use a hypothetical risk-free rate of 1% for these calculations.

**You:**

hypothetical value but you actually don't need it here

**ChatGPT:**

Understood. Since we're not calculating the optimal asset allocation using a specific utility function, we can skip the detailed calculation involving the risk aversion coefficient. Instead, let's focus on visualizing the mean-standard deviation frontier that we've already calculated, which will include the Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio (GMVP) and the Tangency Portfolio. This will provide a graphical representation of the different portfolio combinations of stocks and bonds, their expected returns, and their risks.

I'll create a plot showing the mean-standard deviation frontier, highlighting the GMVP and Tangency Portfolio. Let's proceed with this visualization.
